This is the fourth in a series of posts on scripting administrative functions in SharePoint.  I assume you have already created a farm.  In this post we will add a new anonymous web application.   If you are interested in configuring anonymous access using central administration check out: <a href="http://www.topsharepoint.com/enable-anonymous-access-in-sharepoint-2010.">http://www.topsharepoint.com/enable-anonymous-access-in-sharepoint-2010.</a><br />
An anonymous web application will allow users to access your SharePoint site without logging in.  Let’s start by creating a new web application.  This script is similar to the last web application we created with two changes.   First, we pass AllowAnonymous flag to New-SPAuthenticationProvider.  Similarly, we add the AllowAnonymousAccess flag to New-SPWebApplication.  <i>Note that we have only enabled anonymous access at this point.  By default, new content will still require authentication unless you explicitly grant permissions to anonymous users.</i><br />


{{< highlight powershell "linenos=table" >}}
$WebAppURL = "http://www.brianbeach.com"
$HostHeader = "www.brianbeach.com"
$WebAppName = "Anonymous Web Application"
$ContentDatabase = "Content_Anonymous_Default"
$AppPoolName = "Anonymous Content"
$AppPoolUserName = "DOMAIN\USER_NAME"

Write-Host "Creating the anonymous web application"
$AppPoolCred = Get-Credential $AppPoolUserName
$AppPoolAccount = New-SPManagedAccount -Credential $AppPoolCred
$AuthProvider = New-SPAuthenticationProvider -AllowAnonymous
$WebApp = New-SPWebApplication -AllowAnonymousAccess -ApplicationPool $AppPoolName -ApplicationPoolAccount $AppPoolAccount  -Name $WebAppName -URL $WebAppURL -HostHeader $HostHeader -Port 80 -AuthenticationProvider $AuthProvider -DatabaseName $ContentDatabase

At this point we have a new web application, but there is no content added yet.  Now, let’s add a new site collection and grant permission to anonymous users.  This script is nearly identical to the scripts we created in the prior post, with addition of AnonymousState and AnonymousPermMask.<br />


{{< highlight powershell "linenos=table" >}}
$SiteName = "Anonymous Root Site"
$OwnerEmail = "USER_NAME@DOMAIN.com"
$OwnerAlias = "DOMAIN\USER_NAME"
$SiteURL = "http://www.brianbeach.com"

Write-Host "Creating a default site collection in the anonymous web application"
New-SPSite -Url $SiteURL -owneralias $OwnerAlias -ownerEmail $OwnerEmail -Template "STS#0"
$Web = Get-SPWeb $SiteURL
$Web.title = $SiteName
$Web.AnonymousState = 2;
$Web.AnonymousPermMask64 = "ViewListItems, ViewVersions, ViewFormPages, Open, ViewPages, UseClientIntegration, AddListItems"
$Web.update() 
{{< / highlight >}}


<b>AnonymousState</b> determines if anonymous users have access to the site collection as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li>A "0" disables anonymous access.  In other words, anonymous users have no access to a Web site.</li>
<li>A "1" allows default anonymous access.  This specifies that anonymous users can access lists and libraries if the lists and libraries allow anonymous access.</li>
<li>A "2" specifies that anonymous users can access the entire Web site.</li>
</ul>
<b>AnonymousPermMask</b> allows you to control granular permissions.  The values of the mask (taken directly from the source code) are:<br />
<ul>
<li>ViewListItems = View items in lists, documents in document libraries, and view Web discussion</li>
<li>AddListItems = items to lists, add documents to document libraries, and add Web discussion</li>
<li>EditListItems = Edit items in lists, edit documents in document libraries, edit Web discussion comments in documents, and customize Web Part Pages in document libraries.</li>
<li>DeleteListItems = Delete items from a list, documents from a document library, and Web discussion comments in documents.</li>
<li>ApproveItems = Approve a minor version of a list item or document.</li>
<li>OpenItems = View the source of documents with server-side file handlers.</li>
<li>ViewVersions = View past versions of a list item or document.</li>

When granted on the root Web site of a site collection, activate, deactivate or edit properties of site collection scoped Features through the object model. To browse to the Site Collection Features page and activate or deactivate site collection scoped Features through the UI, you must be a site collection administrator.</li>
<li>UseClientIntegration = Use features that launch client applications; otherwise, users must work</li>
<li>UseRemoteAPIs = Use SOAP, WebDAV, or Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007 interfaces to access the Web site.</li>
