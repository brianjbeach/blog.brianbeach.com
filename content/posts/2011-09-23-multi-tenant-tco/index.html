I recently presented an overview of multi-tenancy in one of my MBA classes. &nbsp;I discussed how multi-tenant applications allow cloud vendors to achieve economies of scale. &nbsp;As an example, I showed the effect on total cost of ownership for the infrastructure if a cloud vendor moved from physical to virtual and then to a multi-tenant architecture. &nbsp;The multi-tenant architecture cuts cost by 80%.<br />

<b>Current State</b><br />
<br />
Imagine that you work at a midsize company that develops and hosts a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution. &nbsp;You have been growing recently and now have 100 customers. &nbsp;Each customer gets its own server that your company hosts in its datacenter.<br />
<br />
You are currently supporting 100 physical servers. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the average utilization is only about 10%. &nbsp;Over three years, the total cost of ownership is about $2.2M ($1M for hardware acquisition, $400K for power, and $800K for support).<br />
<br />
<b>Virtualization</b><br />
<br />
Now imagine that IT moves to virtualization. &nbsp;If we are only 10% utilized, it follows that we only need 10 physical servers (each hosting 10 virtual servers). &nbsp;Leaving some room for growth and sudden spikes in demand, we decide to be safe and buy 20 servers (each hosting 5 virtual servers). &nbsp; <br />
<br />
This cuts our acquisition costs by 30%, and our power costs 80%, but notice that our support costs have gone up by 20%. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;We now have 20 additional servers to support (100 VMs and 20 physical). <br />
<br />
<b>Multi-Tenancy</b><br />
<br />
Now image that we rewrote our applications to allow us to host multiple clients on the same server (i.e. multi-tenant). &nbsp;Again we decide to be safe and buy 20 servers. &nbsp;But, note that we longer need the 100 virtual servers. &nbsp;Therefore, our acquisition costs drop dramatically. &nbsp;We just cut $500K in licensing costs. &nbsp;In addition, out support team is only supporting 20 servers saving another $750K. <br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b><br />
<br />
Multi-tenant applications have dramatic impact on total cost of ownership. &nbsp;This allows cloud vendors to achieve economies of scale. &nbsp; What does this mean for the CIO? &nbsp;In general the best option for the average IT department is virtualization. &nbsp;Therefore, a SaaS solution can often be cheaper than hosting a solution in your own datacenter. &nbsp;This is true even after the vendor applies his markup.<br />

BTW: Checkout the spreadsheet&nbsp;<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13738331/Blog/MultiTenetTCO.xlsx">here</a>. &nbsp;You can&nbsp;adjust&nbsp;my assumptions and tune the results.&nbsp;</div>
