I was recently debugging an issue with a fleet of Apache web servers. &nbsp;I needed to watch for some low level network events we felt might be causing an issue (TCP resets, etc.). &nbsp;I thought CloudWatch Logs would be a cool, albeit unnecessary, solution. <br />
<br />
<i>NOTE: I found a much cleaner way to do this presented <a href="http://blog.brianbeach.com/2014/09/cloudwatch-logs-push.html">here</a>.</i><br />
<br />
The awslogs package/daemon can be configured to upload any log file. &nbsp;Just add a new configuration block to&nbsp;/etc/awslogs/awslogs.conf. &nbsp;For example, the configuration below says to upload the contents of /var/log/tcpdump to a stream identified with the servers instance id in a log group called NetworkTrace. &nbsp;Note that the group and stream must be created on the AWS console first.<br />

{{< highlight ini "linenos=table" >}}
[/var/log/tcpdump]
file = /var/log/tcpdump
log_group_name = NetworkTrace
log_stream_name = {instance_id}
datetime_format = %Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S.%f
{{< / highlight >}}

<br />
With that done, you can start tcptrace and have it dump to a file. &nbsp;But, by default, tcp trace does not include the full date and time in each record. &nbsp;You need to include the -tttt option to so that awslogs can parse the date and time correctly. &nbsp;The -tttt option will use the format 2014-09-24 15:20:29.522949.<br />
<br />
Now simply start a background process to dump the trace to a file and you should start to see events in CloudWatch. &nbsp;For example, this will capture everything with minimal detail.<br />

{{< highlight bash "linenos=table" >}}
sudo tcpdump -tttt >> /var/log/tcpdump &
{{< / highlight >}}

If you want to capture more detail, you should filter it for only some events. &nbsp;For example, the this will capture all traffic on port 80 including a hex dump of the data. <br />
<br />

{{< highlight bash "linenos=table" >}}
sudo tcpdump -tttt -nnvvXS tcp port 80 >> /var/log/tcpdump &
{{< / highlight >}}
