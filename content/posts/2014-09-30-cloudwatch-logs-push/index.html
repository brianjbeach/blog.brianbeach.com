In my last post I used the awslogs daemon to push tcpdump events to AWS CloudWatch logs. &nbsp;At the time it felt silly to use a file on disk and a daemon to push events from an interactive session. &nbsp;Well I had some time to dig and I found a much cleaner way to do it without the daemon. <br />
<br />
It turns out that CloudWatch logs is implemented as a plugin to the AWS CLI. &nbsp;The plugin can be configured to read from a file or you can simply pipe events directly yo it on the command line. <br />
<br />
You need to register the plugin in your config file (~/.aws/config). &nbsp;Mine looks like this. <br />

{{< highlight ini "linenos=table" >}}
[plugins]
cwlogs = cwlogs
[default]
region = us-east-1
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = YYYYYYYYYY
{{< / highlight >}}

<br />
Now you can simply pipe data to "aws logs push." &nbsp;You need to specify the group stream and date format as parameters. &nbsp;And, of course, the group and stream must already exist in AWS. &nbsp;For example:
<br />

{{< highlight batch "linenos=table" >}}
sudo tcpdump -tttt port 80 | aws logs push --log-group-name NetworkTrace --log-stream-name i-125731f9 --datetime-format '%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S.%f'
{{< / highlight >}}
