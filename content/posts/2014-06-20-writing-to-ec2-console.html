I have been building a bunch of Windows AMIs for EC2 recently. &nbsp;If the instance fails to build it can be a real bear to diagnose issues. &nbsp;You don't have access to the console to watch what's happening. &nbsp;It would be great if I could log to the EC2 Console (also called the System Log on the web site) so I knew what was happening. &nbsp;So I hacked the EC2Config Service to see how it was writing to the console.<br />
<br />
The EC2 Console, it turns out, is listening to Serial Port COM1. &nbsp;So if want to write a message to the log, all you have to do is write to COM1. &nbsp;Of course the EC2 Config Service already has COM1 open, so we have to close it first. &nbsp;Here is a quick sample.<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush:powershell;">Stop-Service Ec2Config
$Port = New-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort
$Port.PortName = "COM1"
$Port.BaudRate = 0x1c200
$Port.Parity = [System.IO.Ports.Parity]::None
$Port.DataBits = 8
$Port.StopBits = [System.IO.Ports.StopBits]::One
$Port.Open()
$Port.WriteLine("This was written directly to the serial port");
$Port.Close()
</pre>
<br />
You can also use a helper class that ships with EC2 Config Service called ConsoleLibrary. &nbsp;This implementation is thread-safe, adds the date and time, and takes care of all the serial port configuration details. &nbsp;Of course you still need to close the EC2 Config Service before running this code. <br />
<br />
<pre class="brush:powershell;">#Stop the EC2 Config Service
Stop-Service Ec2Config
#Ensure the log file exists or you will get an error
New-Item -ItemType File -Force -Path 'C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Logs\Ec2ConfigLog.txt'
#Load the Ec2Config Library
[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom("C:\Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Ec2ConfigLibrary.dll")
#Write to the Console
[ConsoleLibrary.ConsoleLibrary]::Instance().WriteToConsole("This was written using the Ec2ConfigLibrary", $true)</pre>
<br />
As you can see below, me messages appear mixed in with the standard console messages, but note that the Console is only updated during boot. &nbsp;If you write to the log after boot the messages will not appear until the next reboot. <br />
