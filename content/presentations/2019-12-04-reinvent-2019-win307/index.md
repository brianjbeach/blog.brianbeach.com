# Manage Windows instances at scale with Systems Manager

I'll be presenting the following workshop at re:Invent 2019.

> Get hands-on experience managing Windows servers with AWS Systems Manager. Examples include the life cycle of an application, automating the creation and management of a “golden AMI,” domain join, application installation, patching, and collecting inventory. Experience with Windows administration and PowerShell are expected for this session. Please bring a laptop (and charger) for the hands-on exercises.
