# High-velocity service delivery: Infrastructure as code

I'll be presenting the following Chalk Talk three times at re:Invent 2019.

> Customers today are looking to the cloud to help them evolve, adapt, and innovate faster than ever. In this chalk talk, learn how to use AWS native services to increase your organizationâ€™s ability to deliver at high velocity using services like AWS CloudFormation, AWS OpsWorks, and AWS Systems Manager. We talk about best practices to help you provision and manage infrastructure, deploy code, and automate your software-release processes.
