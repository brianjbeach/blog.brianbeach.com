# Microsoft SQL Server Migration Strategies

I'll be presenting the following Chalk Talk AWS NYC Summit 2019.

> Migrating SQL Server databases to the cloud is a critical part of a cloud journey and requires planning and architectural considerations. In this session, we cover best practices and guidelines in migrating and/or architecting a hybrid SQL Server architecture on AWS. We compare and contrast various migration methods, including SQL export, backup and restore, and using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). We also provide guidance on how to migrate products that have approached their end of life, such as SQL Server 2008.
