# Visually build extensible, full-stack apps faster with AWS Amplify

**Abstract:** AWS Amplify lets frontend and full-stack web and mobile developers quickly build feature-rich apps on AWS with the flexibility to access over 200 AWS services as use cases evolve. Amplify Studio is a new visual development environment that lets developers build and ship complete apps in hours instead of weeks. In this session, learn how you can build an app backend; create custom UI components; allow designers to customize components in Figma, which can then be imported into Amplify Studio; and connect a UI to an app backend with minimal coding. Developing a full-stack app on AWS just got easier, and this session shows you how.
