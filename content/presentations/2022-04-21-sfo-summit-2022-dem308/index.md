# Accelerate frontend web and mobile development with AWS Amplify

**Abstract:** User-facing web and mobile applications are the primary touchpoint between organizations and their customers. To meet the ever-rising bar for customer experience, developers must deliver high-quality applications with both foundational and differentiating features. AWS Amplify helps frontend web and mobile developers build full-stack applications faster. This session reviews AWS Amplifyâ€™s core capabilities, including authentication, data, file storage, and geolocation, and introduces new capabilities such as extensibility features for easier backend customization with AWS services. See how you can now visually build your application front to back, from developing the frontend UI to configuring the application backend and connecting them with the new Amplify Studio.
