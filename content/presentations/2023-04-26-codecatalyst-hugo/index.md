You’ve built and deployed your first app on Amazon CodeCatalyst – great! But now your users are hungry for technical details and you need a docs page, stat. Join this session to see how you can use CodeCatalyst to build a production-ready website that is set up for long-term success. We will create the project in real time, add collaborators to populate content, and deploy a site that you can access online – all in under a half an hour.
