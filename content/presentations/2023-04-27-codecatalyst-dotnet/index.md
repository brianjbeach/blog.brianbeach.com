Software developers spend a significant amount of time orchestrating tools, technologies, processes, and people to build and deliver modern applications. Amazon CodeCatalyst brings together everything software development teams need to plan, code, build, test, and deploy applications into a streamlined, integrated experience. In this session we will show you how to build .Net and PowerShell projects in a CodeCatalyst cloud Dev Environment. We will then create a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy the project to AWS Lambda.
