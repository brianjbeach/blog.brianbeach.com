**Abstract:** The Builder Experience (BEX) TFC is seeking opportunities to collaborate with other TFCs and Amazonians in general. We all spend too much time working in isolation and duplicating effort. If you are working on a project (e.g. blog post, reference architecture, workshop, re:Invent session) BEX would like to help you develop CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, etc. We aim to help create great content that follows AWS best practices in a standard and consistent manner. In addition, please join to learn more about the Builder Experience TFC and what we do.
