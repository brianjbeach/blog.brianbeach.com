# Designing and Deploying an AWS Account Factory

AWS customers start off with one AWS account, but quickly realize the benefits of having multiple AWS accounts. A common learning curve for customers is how to securely baseline and set up new accounts at scale. This talk helps you understand how to use AWS Organizations, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS CloudFormation, and other tools to baseline new accounts, set them up for federation, and make a secure and repeatable account factory to create new AWS accounts. Walk away with demos and tools to use in your own environment.
