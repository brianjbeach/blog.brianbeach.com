Danielle Kucera, Karun Bakshi, and I were privileged to organize the DevOps and Developer Productivity (DOP) track for re:Invent 2022. For 2022, the DOP track included 58 sessions and nearly 100 speakers.  If you werenâ€™t able to attend, I have compiled a list of the on-demand sessions for you below.
