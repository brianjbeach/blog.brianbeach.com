I had the privilege of working with four talented interns, [Anjan Amarnath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjan-amarnath/), [Aravind Ramalingam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravind-ramalingam-70187bbb/), [Chihao Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chihao-sun-749132191/), and [Hongyi Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hongyi-hiroki/) this summer to build a workshop on .NET Modernization.

> In this workshop, you will migrate a monolithic .NET framework application to a microservices-based .NET Core application on AWS by applying the Strangler Fig Pattern. After completing this workshop, you will have the skills to feel more comfortable modernizing your legacy .NET Framework applications using AWS services and features including Amazon Cognito, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Elastic Container Service, AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT), AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), and others.
