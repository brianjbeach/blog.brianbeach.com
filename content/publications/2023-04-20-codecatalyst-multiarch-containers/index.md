AWS Graviton Processors are designed by AWS to deliver the best price performance for your cloud workloads running in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Amazon CodeCatalyst recently added support to run workflow actions using on-demand or pre-provisioned compute powered by AWS Graviton processors. Customers can now access high performance AWS Graviton processors to build artifacts for Arm, or improve their price performance. In this post I will show you how to create a multi-architecture docker image using CodeCatalyst that can run on both amd64 and arm64 processors.
