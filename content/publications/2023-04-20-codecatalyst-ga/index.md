We are pleased to announce that Amazon CodeCatalyst is now generally available. CodeCatalyst is a unified software development service that brings together everything teams need to get started planning, coding, building, testing, and deploying applications on AWS. CodeCatalyst was designed to make it easier for developers to spend more time developing application features and less time setting up project tools, creating and managing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, provisioning and configuring various development and deployment environments, and onboarding project collaborators. You can learn more and get started building in minutes on the AWS Free Tier at the CodeCatalyst website.
